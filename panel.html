            Education Diplomacy: How International Perspectives Can Affect the Next Generation
        </h2>
        <p>
            The Forum for World Education (FWE), in collaboration with China Global Television Network (CGTN), is hosting a panel discussion titled "Education Diplomacy: How International Perspectives Can Affect the Next Generation" on September 28th, 2024.
            <br />
            This event will explore the role of education as a form of diplomacy, examining how international perspectives and experiences can shape the future of global leadership and foster a more peaceful world. With an emphasis on American universities’ global campuses (like NYU Shanghai) and the historical context of international students in the U.S., the discussion will highlight the significance of international education in shaping the leaders of tomorrow.
